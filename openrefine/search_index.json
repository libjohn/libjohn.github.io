Recent modification of this workbook were written to augment a series of slide deck presentations developed for the Data Science Visualization Institute for Librarians. The slides and workbook work together, along with face-to-face presentations, to encourage data savvy skills development. Use these resources to guide your learning through a series of data experiments illustrating different aspects of data manipulation. Short-clip, silent video presentations are integrated into the workbook chapters. The soundless quality of these instructional videos are intended to enhance student learning during group learning labs by offering addition instructional options during group training sessions. The videos can also serve to illustrate concepts and techniques presented in the workbook, which otherwise has minimal explanatory text.
