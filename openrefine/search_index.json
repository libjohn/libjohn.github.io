This reconciliation function is called semi-automated because the end-user is given the opportunity to interactively approve or select which data are modified by choosing from a pick-list of results. This process can be used to improve and standardize individual data fields or columns of data inside of OpenRefine. Or it can be used to extend the data in OpenRefine. For example: Match each name in a list of authors against an external authoritative list of authors. Augment the authoritative entry of each author’s name; Add an example book title for each author. 5.1 Reconciliation Goal: Import new author data into a new project, Use the WikiData and VIAF reconciliation services to gather authoritative versions of African American author names and an example of each author’s work, plus their placed of birth and death.
