  &lt;h2&gt;Twitter Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
]



---
## Outline

- Using rtweet (a tidy way)  

    - library(twitter) should also work fine

- Analysis demonstrations

    - WordCloud
        - Word Freq
        - term document matrix
    - Sentiment Analysis
    - Network Graphs / Network Analysis
    - Time Series

- Streaming / Scheduling / Sampling

---
class: middle, center, softblue
## Gettting Started 

[Intro Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/intro.html)


---
## Authentication

- API
    - https://apps.twitter.com/
    
- Keys and Access Tokens

- Must be careful with the secret code
    - https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet/articles/auth.html

- But, my examples don't seem to require keys

---
## Gathering is Easy

```{}
mm_tweets &lt;- search_tweets("marchmadness", n=1000, lang = "en")
```


```{}
users_data(mm_tweets)
```



There are significant limitations in gathering historical data from the twitter API

---
## API Orchestration

Many Tools can gather 

- Easy:  https://tags.hawksey.info/

- R with rtweet

- Splunk 


---
class: softblue
## Analysis

1. Word Cloud

2. Sentiment Analysis

3. Network Graph Analysis

4. Time Series

---
class: orange
## Word Cloud

- WordCloud2 (HTML Widget)

- Requires treatment and transformations

    - Term Document Matrix
    - Text Mining
        - lower case
        - strip whitespace
        - remove punctuation
        - remove numbers
        - remove stop words
        - term stemming

[Example 1](rtweet4rfun.nb.html): Search Tweets | Data Treatment | TDM | WorldCloud

---
class: orange
## Sentiment Analysis

Applied a simpler text treatment for this demonstration.
See [Example 1](rtweet4rfun.nb.html) for a more complete treatment of data cleaning. 

```{}
iconv(TweetText, 'UTF-8', 'ASCII') -&gt; UseableText
```
    
Get sentiment

```{}
get_nrc_sentiment(UsableText)
```


---
class:  bottom, center
background-image:  url(images/sentiment_vis.png)

[Example 2](sentiment_analysis.nb.html): syuzhet::get_nrc_sentiment(), plot sentiment


---
class: orange
## Network Graph

- `library(graphTweets)`

- Transforms the document into edges and nodes

- Creates a Gephi Document:  `graphTweets.graphml`

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

- HTML Widget [DiagrammeR](https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR) is worth investigation

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(images/network_graph.png)

1. [Example 3](network_graph.nb.html): `getEdges()` | `getNodes()` | plot

2. Launch Gephi &gt; Open Graph File &gt; graphTweets.graphml

### Notes on previous slide

Although rtweet has `lookup_coords()` I did not find it to be successful for my test.  It may work fine upon further review.  I chose to use ggmap and leaflet.  see [my R Notebook](network_graph_more_examples.nb.html) for code details
